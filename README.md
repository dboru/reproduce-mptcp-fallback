# A script to reproduce mptcp fallback problem  

How to run 
-----------------

sh run-test.sh (root)

MPTCP path manager and number of subflows can be changed in the python script (mfull-messh.py)

Dependencies


1. Mininet (verison 2.3.0d1)
2. Ryu SDN controller (pip install ryu or git clone git://github.com/osrg/ryu.git ; cd ryu; pip install 
3. MPTCP kernel (v0.94), python (2.7), Ubuntu 16.04 (v 4.14.79)

Trace dump from my test is available in https://github.com/dboru/reproduce-mptcp-fallback/blob/master/output/files-pcap.tar.gz

Before you run the test build the client-server application. 

New request traces can also be generated by builing the request-trace-generator. To generate trace clean up the old request trace (rm output.trace in trace_file subdirectory) and do 

./trace_generator 10 500  (Note. 500 is number of requests, 10 the link capacity (bandwidth), don't change the bandwith unless you updated the link capacities in mfull-mesh.py script).
